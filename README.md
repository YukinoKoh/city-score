Change/add city name and location data in `cityList` in `model.js` as the following. 
```
name: name of the city (string),
lat: latitude (float)
lng: longitude (float)
```
The score data will be retirieved from Teleport by calling `updateData` in `viewModel` function.

### To add/edit/delete receiving score data kind
1. Modify data with `SCORE_NAME_IN_MODEL` in `cityModel`, which is defined in `viewModel`
```
SCORE_NAME_IN_MODEL: ko.observable(0),
```
2. Modify `SCORE_NAME` in following in `viewModel` in `model.js`
```
if (score_list[i]['name'] == 'SCORE_NAME'){
city.SCORE_NAME_IN_MODEL(score_list[i]['score_out_of_10']);
```
3. Apply the `SCORE_NAME` in `index.html`
```
 SCORE_NAME score: <div data-bind="text: SCORE_NAME_IN_MODEL" class="i-score"></div>
```

## Other javascript tips

var app = app || {}
```
